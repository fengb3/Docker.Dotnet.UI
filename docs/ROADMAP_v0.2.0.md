## Technical Architecture Changes

### New Components for v0.2.0

1. **API Layer**
   - `Controllers/Api/` - REST API controllers
   - `Services/ApiServices/` - API business logic
   - JWT authentication middleware
   - API versioning support

2. **Compose Management**
   - `ViewModels/ComposePageViewModel.cs`
   - `Components/Pages/DockerPages/ComposePage.razor`
   - `Services/ComposeService.cs`
   - YAML parsing and validation

3. **Terminal/Exec**
   - `Hubs/TerminalHub.cs` - SignalR hub
   - `Services/TerminalService.cs` - Container exec management
   - Frontend: xterm.js integration

4. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - `Services/MonitoringService.cs` - Background monitoring
   - `Models/Monitoring/` - Metrics data models
   - Chart.js integration for historical data

### Infrastructure Updates

1. **Database Schema**
   - User preferences storage
   - Alert configurations
   - API usage tracking
   - Audit log tables

2. **Background Services**
   - Resource monitoring worker
   - Alert evaluation service
   - Cleanup/maintenance tasks

3. **Frontend Enhancements**
   - Chart.js for monitoring graphs
   - xterm.js for terminal access
   - File upload components
   - Enhanced responsive design

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Set up API infrastructure and JWT auth
- Basic Compose file parsing and UI
- Database schema updates
- Development environment enhancements

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 5-10)
- Complete Docker Compose management
- Implement container terminal access
- Build out REST API endpoints
- Enhanced monitoring dashboard

### Phase 3: Polish & Testing (Weeks 11-14)
- Image building features
- Advanced container options
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation updates
- Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Release Preparation (Weeks 15-16)

- Release packaging

## Breaking Changes & Migration

### Database Migration
- New tables for preferences, alerts, API usage
- Existing user accounts preserved
- Automatic migration on startup

### Configuration Changes
- New `appsettings.json` sections for API, monitoring
- Environment variables for new features
- Backward compatible with v0.1.0 configs

### UI Changes
- New navigation menu items
- Additional pages for Compose and monitoring
- Existing workflows unchanged

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- Container terminal access: 90% user satisfaction
- Compose management: Support for 95% of common use cases
- API adoption: At least 20% of users utilize APIs

### Performance
- Terminal response time: <500ms average
- API response time: <200ms for simple operations
- UI responsiveness: No degradation from v0.1.0

### Quality
- Zero high-severity security vulnerabilities
- 95% test coverage for new features
- <5% regression rate from v0.1.0

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Terminal security**: Container exec could expose host
- **API security**: New attack surface with REST APIs
- **Compose complexity**: Many edge cases in YAML parsing

### Medium Risk
- **Performance impact**: Background monitoring overhead
- **Browser compatibility**: xterm.js and SignalR requirements
- **Docker version compatibility**: New Docker API features

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive security review for terminal/API features
- Extensive testing across Docker versions
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Progressive enhancement for browser features
