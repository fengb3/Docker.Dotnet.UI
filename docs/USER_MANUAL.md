Welcome to Docker.Dotnet.UI - a modern web-based interface for managing Docker containers, images, volumes, and networks. This guide will help you navigate and use all the features effectively.

## Login and Authentication

### First Time Login
1. Open your browser and navigate to the application URL (typically http://localhost:8080)
2. Use the default credentials:
   - **Username**: `admin`

  - Running containers (green)
  - Stopped containers (red)
  - Paused containers (yellow)

### Quick Navigation
Click on any resource card to jump directly to the management page for that resource type.

## Container Management

Navigate to **Containers** from the main menu to manage your Docker containers.

### Viewing Containers
- **List View**: See all containers with status, image, ports, and creation time

### Container Operations

#### Starting and Stopping
- **Start**: Click the play button to start a stopped container
- **Stop**: Click the stop button to gracefully stop a running container

- **Delete**: Remove containers (stopped containers only)

#### Container Terminal (Exec)
The terminal feature allows you to access an interactive shell inside running containers directly from your browser.

**Features:**
- **Dialog Mode**: Quick terminal access from the container list
- **Full-Screen Mode**: Dedicated page for extended sessions
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically selects the appropriate shell (sh, bash, or powershell)
- **Real-Time I/O**: Bidirectional streaming for command execution and output

**How to Use:**
1. Ensure the container is in "running" state (terminal button is enabled only for running containers)
2. Click the **Terminal** button (terminal icon) in the container actions
3. A dialog opens showing:
   - Connection status (Connecting/Connected/Disconnected)
   - Terminal output area with monospace font on dark background
   - Command input field at the bottom
4. Type commands and press Enter to execute
5. Use the **Clear** button to clear terminal output

- üöÄ Monitor system resources on the dashboard
- üöÄ Close unused dialog windows

### Security Reminders
- üîí Change default passwords immediately
- üîí Review container configurations regularly
- üîí Limit access to sensitive containers
- üîí Monitor logs for suspicious activity

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Dashboard Shows "Cannot Connect to Docker"
- Ensure Docker daemon is running
- Check Docker socket permissions
- Restart the application if needed

### Operations Fail with Permission Errors
- Verify Docker socket access
- Check user permissions
- Ensure containers are in correct state for operation

### Slow Performance
- Too many containers/images - use search/filtering
- Check system resources on dashboard
- Consider cleanup of unused resources

### Language Not Displaying Correctly
- Try refreshing the page
- Check browser language settings
- Contact support if text appears as keys (e.g., "CONTAINER_NAME")
